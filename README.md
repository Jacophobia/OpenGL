# Overview

These are my OpenGL programs. I am just learning how to work in OpenGL to create graphics in my programs.

I have been mostly backend programming for a long while and really wanted to write something visual that a user can interact with rather than code that interacts with other programs or just interacts with a user from command line.

# Development Environment

These 32 bit programs are written in the C++ programming language with all dependencies located in the ExternalLibs folder.

I use the following libraries:
* GLEW - for use with OpenGL data types and OpenGL functions
* GLFW - for window creation and user input
* GLM  - for vector math
* STB  - for textures

# Future Work

1. Enable the import of any 3d model file
1. Create objects which contain shader, mesh, material, texture, position, rotation, and scale properties
1. Introduce collision detection
